        <h2>This is how we can 'select' the various elements on our page</h2>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>In CSS, a class is a reusable styling rule that can be applied to multiple elements on a webpage. Classes help organize and maintain styles efficiently, allowing for consistent and scalable design across a website.</p>
        <p>A CSS class is defined using a <strong>dot <code>(.)</code> prefix</strong> in a CSS file and applied to elements using the <code>class</code> attribute in HTML.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One</li>
            <li>Two</li>
            <li>Three</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>IDs</h2>
        <p>In CSS, an ID selector is used to apply styles to a specific, unique element on a webpage. Unlike classes, which can be reused across multiple elements, an ID should only be assigned to one element per page for best practices.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Link Selector</h2>
        <p>The link selector in CSS is used to style <a href="#">hyperlinks</a> in an HTML document. It allows you to define how links appear in different states, such as when they are unvisited, visited, hovered over, or active.</p>
